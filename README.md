# DTSA-5510-Projects
 Repository of projects for DTSA 5510 - Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning.

 **DTSA-5510 Mini Project:** 
 The BBC article dataset from Kaggle is used for a text-based classification task. Features are extracted from the text of BBC news articles and two classification approaches are compared.
 A supervised learning classification approach is compared to a matrix factorization/completion approach.

 **DTSA-5510 Reccomendation System Using Matrix Completion Methods:**
 A mini-project from the DTSA-5510 coursework in which a sample dataset for a video streaming service consisting of per user content ratings and video content features are used to prepare a recommendation system via matrix completion methods.
 Sparse matrix calculations are utilized to show performance improvements on large datasets with sparse non-zero entries and various similarity metrics are compared for performance.
